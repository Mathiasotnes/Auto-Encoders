# Auto-Encoders
Deep learning auto-encoders used for generative models and anomaly detection. 

# Technologies
- Tensorflow


# Implementation status

### AE-BASIC - COMPLETED
Implement the autoencoder, learn from standard MNIST data, and show reconstruction results.

### AE-GEN - COMPLETED
Show results for the AE-as-a-generator task on MNIST data.

### AE-ANOM - COMPLETED
Show results for the AE-as-an-anomaly-detector task on MNIST data. Show the top-k anomalous examples from the test set.

### AE-STACK - COMPLETED
Show the results for the AE-GEN and AE-ANOM tasks when learn- ing from StackedMNIST data. Be prepared to discuss how you adapted the model structure when going from one to three color channels.

### VAE-BASIC - X
Implement the variational autoencoder, learn from standard MNIST data, and show reconstruction results.

### VAE-GEN - X
Show results for the VAE-as-a-generator task on MNIST data.

### VAE-ANOM - X
Show results for the VAE-as-an-anomaly-detector task on MNIST data. NOTE! This is different from the AE-ANOM code. Simply doing the same as for the AE will give zero points.

### VAE-STACK - X
Show the results for the VAE-GEN and VAE-ANOM tasks when learning from StackedMNIST data.
